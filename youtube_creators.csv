Practical Personal Finance,UCjNeF9lzg7hJbQE5OtehFdA,"Your current financial situation is a reflection of how you've treated money in the past. Change the way you treat money, and you will change your life. 

In April of 2018, my wife and I took our first steps on the road toward financial independence. Three years later, we've paid off over $182,500 in debt, made crucial pivots in our careers, and purchased our first home. In doing so, we've learned to treat money in a whole new way. I started this channel to share everything I've learned, and to give you the information you need to understand and succeed with money.
